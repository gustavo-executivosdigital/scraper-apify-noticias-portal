Searches **Google News** for any term, picks the strongest stories with AI, rewrites each one as an **original article** ready to republish, and generates an **editorial image** for it — all in one run.

## What does Notícias Portal Rewriter do?

Give it a search term like `taxas de logística` or `zé felipe e ana maria`. The Actor finds recent news on Google, extracts the **full text** of each article, then uses a **Groq AI** to select the best ones (you choose how many). Each selected story is **rewritten in fresh, original wording** — same facts and structure, no copied sentences — so it is safe to republish on your own portal. Finally it generates a matching **news image** with **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana)** via **OpenRouter**.

Running on the Apify platform gives you API access, scheduling, integrations, proxy rotation, and run monitoring out of the box.

## Why use Notícias Portal Rewriter?

- **Content portals** that republish news at scale without manual copywriting.
- **Newsletters and social pages** that need fresh, original takes on trending stories.
- **SEO** — original text plus an original image avoids duplicate-content penalties.
- **Speed** — discovery, selection, rewriting, and illustration in a single automated run.

## How to use Notícias Portal Rewriter

1. Enter a **search term** (`searchQuery`).
2. Set **how many articles to fetch** (`maxArticles`) and **how many the AI should select** (`numToSelect`).
3. Paste your **Groq API key** (free at https://console.groq.com).
4. Paste your **OpenRouter API key** (from https://openrouter.ai/keys) to generate high-quality images. Without it, the Actor still publishes the rewritten text, just without images.
5. Click **Start** and read the results in the **Output** tab.

## Output

Each republished article is one dataset item. You can download the dataset in JSON, HTML, CSV, or Excel. Generated images are stored in the run's key-value store and linked from `imageUrl`.

```json

## Data table

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rewrittenTitle` / `rewrittenBody` | The original, republishable article. |
| `originalTitle` / `originalUrl` / `source` | Where the story came from (attribution). |
| `score` / `selectionReason` | Why the AI picked this story. |
| `imageUrl` / `imagePrompt` | The generated image and the prompt used. |

## Cost estimation

Cost comes mainly from two composed Actors — `apify/google-search-scraper` (discovery) and `apify/website-content-crawler` (full-text extraction) — plus this Actor's compute. The AI calls run on **your own Groq and OpenRouter keys**, so the text and image generation add no Apify platform cost. Fetch fewer articles (`maxArticles`) to reduce Compute Units.

## Tips

- Lower `maxArticles` and raise `numToSelect` close to it to spend less on extraction.
- Set `enableImage: false` to skip image generation (and its OpenRouter cost) when you only need the rewritten text.
- Schedule the Actor (e.g. hourly) to keep a portal continuously fed with fresh stories.

## FAQ, disclaimers, and support

- **Is republishing legal?** You are responsible for how you use the output. Rewriting preserves facts but you should still credit sources and respect each publisher's Terms of Service and copyright.
- **Why was a story skipped?** Some sites block extraction (paywalls, cookie walls); those articles are dropped before selection.
- **Image didn't generate?** Check your OpenRouter key/credits — the Actor logs the reason and still publishes the text. Feedback and issues are welcome in the Issues tab.
